        <h3>Twenty-Four Hour Call Bell System</h3>
        <p>We also operate a twenty-four hour call bell system within the home.  All of our bedrooms have at least two remote controlled call bells, usually one by the bed and one in the en-suite facility.  All communal area have at least one call bell per room and alternately Residents are able to carry their own system from their rooms with them should they choose.  We also have a range of call bellâ€™s available such as call bell leads with push button, sensor matts, door alarms, and neck pendants.  These can be used to minimise your risk of falls, for your own personal security, or to make life at Park House more comfortable.  Our call bell system also audits our response times and has confirmed an average response time for general bells within three minutes.</p>
