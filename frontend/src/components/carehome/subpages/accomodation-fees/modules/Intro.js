      <p>Often the individual assessing your care needs will be able to make a decision immediately at the end of the assessment process; however in some more complex cases we will need more time to ensure all your needs can be met safely.  Should this be the case you can usually expect to hear from us within seven days of the initial assessment.</p>

      <p>Your assessor of need will also discuss with you the potential rooms that may be available within Park House, in addition to the pricing/ banding structure.</p>

      <p>Park House uses the ‘Department of Health’s (DOH)’, ‘Fair Access to Care’ criteria.  This allows us and the prospective service user to ascertain what level of care you require and as to what accommodation fees would be fair, realistic, and transparent.</p>

      <p>At Park House each banding has a minimum and maximum price. The cost of accommodation is tailored to your level of care, and also the size of bedroom.  Our managing team has sufficient experience and training to explain the banding and fee structures to you during the initial assessment in more depth should you require.</p>

      <p>We do ask politely that you keep us updated of your decision/ thoughts regarding admission or non-admission within seven days of the initial assessment.   If you are still unsure regarding your decision, then we ask that you keep us updated.  However please be aware that accommodation at Park House cannot be reserved without payment.</p>
