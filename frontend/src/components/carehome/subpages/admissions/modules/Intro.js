      <p>Once you have confirmed your decision to us, we will issue our Terms and Conditions of Residential Care which must be signed and returned prior to admission.  In addition to this we do require immediate payment upon admission.</p>

      <p>On your arrival we aim to make the admission process as relaxed as possible, as we appreciate this can be a very difficult situation.  We encourage any representatives to accompany you and for you to bring personal processions from home.</p>

      <p>We ask politely that all items of clothing are clearly labeled with you name, should you be using our in-house laundry service.  Any items of furniture you would like to bring or any alternations to the room will need to be agreed with the Management team, this is primarily so we can risk assess the changes and also conform to Health and Safety Guidelines.</p>

      <p>Park House has got a safe for any valuable goods, in addition to lockable draws or box’s within your room.  However, we advise resident’s not to keep on the premises any more valuable items or money that necessary.</p>

      <p>The care team will carry out an inventory of your possessions within the first twenty-four hours of admission, this will need to be signed by you or your representative and further items brought into the home added to the inventory.</p>

      <p>The care home already has risk assessments in place for any equipment that is in place. If you want to bring your own equipment, a risk assessment will be undertaken for this and the individual. Other professionals can be bought in to assess your needs and advise on any other equipment that may be available.</p>
