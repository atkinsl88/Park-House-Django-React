      <p>In any of the referral scenarios, information about you which is passed to us will be dealt with sensitively and in confidence. Before providing any services we will need to undertake a care needs assessment visit which involves you, your family, or a representative (as applicable) in order to allow us to gather sufficient information, to be sure that the services we provide are suitable for you.</p>

      <p>This stage of assessing the need is part of the Care Quality Commission regulations, so is unavoidable however will help us to ensure we are able to meet your needs.</p>

      <p>OIf someone comes to us from a social services department, the local authority Care Manager would have usually carried out a full assessment of your care needs.  However, at Park House we like to ensure we comprehensively have assessed your needs to lower the risk of any unforeseen circumstances occurring in relation to your care giving.</p>

      <p>On receipt of the initial referral an assessment of need visit is agreed at a time convenient to the potential service user, and/ or their representative(s).  A competent and qualified member of staff such as the Registered Manager or Assistant Manager undertakes this assessment and the service user and where applicable their family or representative(s) are expected to be fully involved within the process where possible.</p>

      <p>This assessment visit is the first step in being able to deliver the required service.  This is an in depth assessment of the potential service users ability to manage on a day to day basis, so questions of a highly sensitive and private nature have to be asked in order to gain the complete picture of how the potential service user manages their daily activities.</p>

      <p>In order to complete the assessment fully we will need to ask you quite a lot of questions, and probably to seek information from your carer, your doctor, and any other specialists who are involved in your care and will include the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Full medical history</li>
        <li>Personal care and physical well being</li>
        <li>Diet and weight, including dietary preference</li>
        <li>Sight, hearing and communication</li>
        <li>Oral health</li>
        <li>Foot care</li>
        <li>Mobility and dexterity</li>
        <li>History of falls</li>
        <li>Continence</li>
        <li>Medication usage</li>
        <li>Mental state and cognition</li>
        <li>Social interests, hobbies, religious and cultural needs</li>
        <li>Personal safety and risk</li>
        <li>Carer and family involvement and other social contacts/ relationships</li>
        <li>Service User and family expectations</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The assessment process enables Park House to ensure we can meet the potential Service Users needs and to make an initial plan of care that will be provided.</p>

      <p>The assessment is usually undertaken at the service users home or within a hospital setting, so the visit will also include checking any aids or equipment that are in situ and the potential service users ability to transfer from bed to chair or chair to bed.</p>

      <p>This assessment visit usually lasts anywhere between sixty minutes and two hours dependent on the complexity and level of care required.  At the end of the assessment visit the potential service user will be fully involved in discussions to formulate the potential care plan.</p>

      <p>Lastly, your assessor of need will discuss with you the potential rooms that may be available within Park House, in addition to the pricing/ banding structure.</p>
