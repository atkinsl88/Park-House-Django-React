      <p>After admission to the Care Home a continual assessment will be maintained to ensure that your individual needs are met. Each plan of care will be reviewed on a monthly basis unless there is a needs change, in which case it will be reviewed immediately and changed.</p>

      <p>We hope that you do not find the process by which we get to know your needs too intrusive. We want to build up a full picture and we will do this as quickly and tactfully as possible. Remember, all the information will be treated confidentially.</p>

      <p>Our aim is always to make sure that we understand what you need and what your preferences are about services, so that we can respond in ways which really suit you.</p>

      <p>The outcomes that have been agreed in the service user plan are the indicators for us of how successfully the plan has been delivered.  When we come to review the care plan the outcomes will be measured to assess the success of the plan. In the beginning these outcomes may have been set too high or too low so the review mechanism will re-visit these outcomes and amend as appropriate.</p>

      <p>Of course, over time your needs may change. You may need more or less care, the type or pattern of service may have to be varied, new risks may become apparent. So, again with your help, we will keep your needs under review and take decisions about the care accordingly. If at any time there are aspects about the care which you would like to change, let us know.</p>

      <p>Park House operates a robust care reviewing method:</p>

      <p>The number of your room will correspond with the date of your care review each month.  For example, Room 01’s care review will always be carried out on the 01st of each calendar month, Room 02’s care review will always be carried out on the 02nd of each calendar month, and so on.  Care Plans are also audited monthly by the management team to ensure they continue to meet your objectives and needs.</p>

      <p>Care reviews are carried out at 14:00hrs by the Senior Healthcare Assistant or a member of the care co-ordination team.  Alternatively you may wish to specify a member of staff you would like to conduct your review, or perhaps anyone you would like not to conduct the review.</p>

      <p>Care review dates may be changed with a minimum of six hours’ notice. In addition to this we encourage you and any representatives as consented to be involved, you can expect your care review to last anywhere from an hour to three hours dependent on the number of areas needing review.   However should you or your representatives not wish to be involved then we will always ensure we have advised and discussed any changes made to your plan of care.</p>

      <p>Under the requirements of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) e are required to record information which is often of a sensitive and very private nature.  During the care needs assessment visit you will be asked to give consent regarding who accesses this information.</p>

      <p>The outcomes that have been agreed within your plan of care are the indicators for us of how successfully the plan has been or is being delivered.  When we come to review the care plan the outcomes will be measured to assess the success of the plan.</p>

      <p>In the beginning these outcomes may have been set too high or too low so the review mechanism will re-visit these outcomes and amend as appropriate.</p>

      <p>Of course, over time your needs may change. You may need more or less care, the type or pattern of service may have to be varied, new risks may become apparent.

If at any time there are aspects about the care which you would like to change, let us know.</p>

      <p>If at any time you or a representative (as consented) would like an informal chat regarding your care, please do not hesitate to contact the Registered Manager or a member of the senior care team.</p>
