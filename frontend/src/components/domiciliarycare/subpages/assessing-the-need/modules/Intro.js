      <p>If someone comes to us from a social services department, the local authority Care Manager will have carried out an assessment of what you need and have a care diary prepared. On receipt of any initial referral an assessment of need visit is agreed at a time convenient to the Client family or representative.  A competent, qualified member of staff undertakes this assessment and the Client, and the Clients family or representative are expected to be fully involved in the process.</p>

      <p>This assessment visit is the first step in being able to deliver the required service.  This is an in depth assessment of the Clients ability to manage on a day to day basis so questions of a highly sensitive and private nature have to be asked in order to gain the complete picture of how the Client manages their daily activities.</p>

      <p>This is usually undertaken at the Clients home so the visit will also include checking any aids or equipment that are in situ and the Clients ability to mobilise.  The assessment visit usually lasts anything between 45 minutes and 2 hours dependent on the complexity and level of care required.  The assessment process enables Park House Care to be sure that they can meet the potential Clients needs and to make an initial plan of care that will be provided.   The assessment will include the following areas:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Full medical history</li>
        <li>Personal care and physical well being</li>
        <li>Diet and weight, including dietary preference</li>

        <li>Oral health</li>
