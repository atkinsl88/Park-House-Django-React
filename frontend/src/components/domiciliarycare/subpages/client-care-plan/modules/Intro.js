      <p>Should you the Client wish to continue and use Park House Care Services a comprehensive care plan will be tailored to suit your needs and be maintained regularly to ensure that your individual needs are met.</p>

      <p>Two Client files are completed, one is held in the office and the other is held in the Clientsâ€™ home. It is essential therefore that you the Client allow the file to be kept in a safe and secure place which is accessible only to the people for whom access to the file and its contents applies.</p>

      <p>The Client Care Plan will specify the services we will provide, with details like timings of Care Worker visits and any tasks to be performed, and will state the aims and outcomes of the service provided and how we plan to achieve those outcomes.</p>

      <p>We hope that you do not find the process by which we get to know your needs too intrusive. We want to build up a full picture and we will do this as quickly and tactfully as possible. Remember, all the information will be treated confidentially. Our aim is always to make sure that we understand what you need and what your preferences are about services, so that we can respond in ways which really suit you.</p>

      <p>Under the requirements of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2010 Outcome 21 we are required to record information which is often of a sensitive and very private nature.  During the care needs assessment visit you will be asked to give consent regarding who accesses this information.</p>
