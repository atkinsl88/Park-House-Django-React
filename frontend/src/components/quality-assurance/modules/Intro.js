          <li>A annual survey issued to residents, and where appropriate their relatives or representatives, to obtain views and opinions.</li>
          <li>A annual survey issued to general practitioners, and where applicable social workers and district nursing teams, to obtain views and opinions.</li>
          <li>Continually recording and monitoring compliments, complaints, and general feedback.</li>
        </ul>
