          <p><i>“My mother was a resident at Parkhouse for over 4 years. During her stay she could not have been looked after better. She was always treated with dignity, care and compassion. She became very fond of her carers and treated them like family and this was how we felt when visiting. There was always a warm welcome, a cup of tea and an insightful update on how Mum was doing. There were times when she became very poorly and they were always on top of the situation, calling in the doctors or nurses promptly and ensuring any treatment or recommendations were swiftly put in place. Their care was always exceptional and even more so in the weeks leading up to Mum’s passing. They cared for her and us as a family and made a difficult time so much more bearable, leaving us with good memories of Mum’s final years.”</i></p>

          <p><i>“The care and well being of my Mother (who has Dementia) over the last 7 years has been excellent, especially during the current Coronavirus pandemic.   The staff are amazing, always friendly both to residents and relatives alike.  The Activities provide stimulation to the residents that are able to take part and I have experienced hearing my Mother singing along to songs I didn’t even know she knew. In the good weather there is a small garden to enjoy. I can only say “thank you again” for the last 7 years peace of mind Park house has given me and our family.”</i></p>

          <p><i>“When Mum was widowed in 2016, she needed support to live at home and Park House Domiciliary Care provided a great level of care and support.  We also arranged for Mum to go to Park House for lunch occasionally as we knew living at home was short term as her Dementia progressed. When crisis hit, we were lucky that there was a room available at Park House and that the staff already knew Mum so transition was easier. In the home, all the staff are so kind and really get to know their residents, offering suitable activities and spending time with each person as well as meeting the care needs to a high standard. I was always welcomed when visiting and kept well informed of any concerns and changes. It was great to know when the review dates were planned so that I could attend if I wished.</i></p>
          <p><i>Mum had a happy few years at Park House with a team of staff who were consistent, cheerful and kind creating a great atmosphere even when she could be a little challenging!  When Mum deteriorated and it was clear that it she had reached the end of life, the compassion from the whole team was amazing and she was able to slip away peacefully in her own room with us by her side and the love for her was clear.  I would recommend Park House as a lovely home for you, your friend or relative.”</i></p>

          <p><i>“Mum spent the last four years of her long life as a resident at Park House. Her dementia was progressing rapidly and she developed challenging behaviour. Armed with her zimmer frame she would attack the front door with her eye firmly set on freedom. Staff had the unenviable task of trying to reassure her and divert her attention elsewhere. Being locked in for your own safety in a confused state is a scary scenario.</i></p>
          <p><i>The staff always treated her with the respect and dignity she deserved. Eventually she became much calmer and obviously felt secure. Indeed, when visiting us at home she would often want to get back!  She was always happier to be ‘on the edge’ of entertainments and activities on offer and staff would never pressurise her to become more involved than she wanted to be.  When the time came, the end of life care was most appropriate and compassionate. It was such a relief to know that my mother was being cared for in such a safe and unfailing environment which Park House provides.”</i></p>

          <p><i>“From your initial visit to Mum in Hospital through to the end of her life Park House couldn’t have done more to make her feel at home, included and important.  Throughout her time in Park House the staff managed Mum’s medical needs which required an ever-changing pain management plan in a way that was beyond our expectations. This was largely due to the respect you all showed to Mum and her wishes.  Once settled Mum definitely enjoyed her time in park House because as you know if she hadn’t everyone would have known about it!! Thank you all for the daily kindness and support you gave to us and Mum through a very difficult time.”</i></p>
