        <p><i>“The care and well being of my Mother (who has Dementia) over the last 7 years has been excellent, especially during the current Coronavirus pandemic.   The staff are amazing, always friendly both to residents and relatives alike.  The Activities provide stimulation to the residents that are able to take part and I have experienced hearing my Mother singing along to songs I didn’t even know she knew. In the good weather there is a small garden to enjoy. I can only say “thank you again” for the last 7 years peace of mind Park house has given me and our family.”</i></p>
