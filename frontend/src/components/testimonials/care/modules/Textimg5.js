        <p><i>“Mum spent the last four years of her long life as a resident at Park House. Her dementia was progressing rapidly and she developed challenging behaviour. Armed with her zimmer frame she would attack the front door with her eye firmly set on freedom. Staff had the unenviable task of trying to reassure her and divert her attention elsewhere. Being locked in for your own safety in a confused state is a scary scenario.</i></p>
        <p><i>The staff always treated her with the respect and dignity she deserved. Eventually she became much calmer and obviously felt secure. Indeed, when visiting us at home she would often want to get back!  She was always happier to be ‘on the edge’ of entertainments and activities on offer and staff would never pressurise her to become more involved than she wanted to be.  When the time came, the end of life care was most appropriate and compassionate. It was such a relief to know that my mother was being cared for in such a safe and unfailing environment which Park House provides.”</i></p>
