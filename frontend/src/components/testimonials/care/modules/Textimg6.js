        <p><i>“From your initial visit to Mum in Hospital through to the end of her life Park House couldn’t have done more to make her feel at home, included and important.  Throughout her time in Park House the staff managed Mum’s medical needs which required an ever-changing pain management plan in a way that was beyond our expectations. This was largely due to the respect you all showed to Mum and her wishes.  Once settled Mum definitely enjoyed her time in park House because as you know if she hadn’t everyone would have known about it!! Thank you all for the daily kindness and support you gave to us and Mum through a very difficult time.”</i></p>
